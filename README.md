#THE SPIRIT OF COMPUTING 

## Create A Pull Request Now And Lets Have Fun Coding Algorithms üòäÔ∏è

## Its Simple 
### Learn An Algorithm and Pick One That You Really Know 
### Create A Folder For It ( User UnderScore Names, With All Leters In Lower Case, NO SPACES ) 
### Create Your File In The Same Folder, with The Same Name As The Folder with the language file extension. Example,  if the algorithm is Merge Sort and you are coding it in C++. Create A Folder called merge_sort and create a file called merge_sort.cpp in the same folder 
### Start Coding 
### Run run.py {name of folder} 
### Submit Pull Request Now !!!!!
### Lets Have Fun 

## Goal 

I know there are a lot of sites out there with readily coded algorithms in all languages. A quick search with google can gve you all you need. This will however help you to practice algorithms on you own and make it more real to you.
